It's gonna rain.
(Shoshanna) Oh, it's totally not gonna rain.
It's, like, never been about to rain less in the history of the universe.
Now, that looks great and it's ready for some bridesmaid-y action.
By the way, living in Japan has made me so effing good at folding, steaming, pressing, et cetera.
My friend Satako says that I'm, like, a complete natural and could totally compete with the best of them.
They have this reality TV show there called "Fold Fold Press..." - ...which is kind of about being human.
It seems like it's gonna rain, right?
God damn it, what is my mom doing out there?
You don't understand something here. I just want to show you.
It's gotta be candle, flower, candle, flower, candle, flower.
Sorry I slept so late. Is there anything I can do to help?
Um, yeah, just keep the vibe, like, super calm in here.
That'd be great. And then when the hair and makeup artist arrives, you can start maneuvering the appointments.
Got it, on it.
What do you mean by "maneuvering the appointments"?
Well, she can't do all of us at once, right? She's not an octopus, so I figure we need an order and you can create the order.
Cool. I'll... I'm gonna... gonna do it.
(Marnie) Thank you so much. I figure each bridesmaid should take no longer than, like, 35 minutes, and that leaves me three and a half hours, which is perfect.
- Great.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Oh, wow. You look so whimsical/beautiful.
Thank you, I just bathed in the stream and then I ran through the field to dry myself.
Marnie, what's wrong?
I'm worried it's gonna rain. I had the option for a tent, but of course I didn't take it.
Okay, so you made a mistake.
We all make mistakes. It's okay.
Yeah, everybody hates tents anyways.
Like, what, is this a circus? I don't want no big top.
(Jessa) But you know that rain on your wedding day means wonderful things for your fertility.
So I hope that it does rain.
I'm gonna go set out your dress.
If anyone needs anything, I'll be upstairs in the boudoir.
(whispers) I love tents.
This is the day.
This is my wedding day.
(knocks)
- Hi!
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- Good, how you doing?
- Mm, good. Good to see you.
- (Fran) You, too.
Hey, gals.
Ooh, Fran, you look so handsome.
That is beautiful suiting.
Well done, sir.
- Hey, Fran.
- Marnie, hey.
Um, I just wanted to say how grateful I am to be invited.
Oh, well, everyone who asked for a plus one got one.
Shosh didn't ask for one, though.
Oh, yeah, I just... I take my bridesmaids duties, like, super seriously.
Also, I'm in a long-distance relationship, so, like, why rock the boat by seeing each other, you know what I mean?
Well, Fran was just sitting in his car, so I said he could come hang with us.
Um, but I can go if this is not a good time.
Well, you are here, like, super early. So...
No, it's a great time. We're doing literally nothing.
(Fran) Sweet.
- How was your drive?
- Yeah, super easy.
(Hannah) It's so pretty on the way up here.
- (Whispers) Shosh!
- Yeah?
(Hannah) Saw so many baby lambs running
- (Hannah) in the field.
- Come here!
Was there a mom or was it just like - a flock of little lambs?
- No, orphans.
This is so inappropriate.
My attire? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were, like, doing a PJ thing all day.
- I mean, I have another outfit...
- No, no, no, no, no.
Shh. Fran.
- Oh, my baby got out!
- (Hannah) No.
He has an actual penis.
He's a man and he's here.
You have to go tell him to leave, and then you have to tell Hannah that she's been so inappropriate and unsupportive for me all day.
Wouldn't you rather do that?
That kind of just seems like something that you would really enjoy doing.
- Shosh.
- Okay, on it.
- ...had breakfast yet.
- What do you mean,
- you didn't order it or it didn't show up?
- I mean it was fine... No, no one just mentioned breakfast. Fran... um, so, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, just 'cause it's women's hour.
Shosh.
No.
Shosh.
Don't go, stay. It's fine.
I mean, if you want him to go.
But, as the bride, I just want you to know that I'm fine and cool if you stay.
Totally fine if Shosh wants you to leave.
Up to you.
- Ugh, weddings.
- Hannah.
I'm sorry, it's just they're stupid.
They're so stupid and you know what? Ultimately, they're selfish.
Not all weddings.
I mean, yeah, if you put too much weight on the dumb details,
- sure, but this is the...
- Marnie, like, passive-aggressively handed me a razor. I was like, "I already shaved my armpits."
To be fair, you're not great at it.
- It's, like, pretty patchy under there.
- (laughs) It's hard.
- Consistently patchy.
- No.
Look, just try and be positive, okay?
And it's all gonna be over soon.
Yeah, but then she's gonna be married.
- To someone she barely knows.
- She barely knows him?
No, I barely know him. You're not even listening to what I'm saying.
- Hey.
- (Hannah) Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What are they...
(Ray) Oh, ah, yeah, they're actually not here right now.
- Yeah, they're transcending.
- (Hannah) Got it.
Should be back any minute, though. Just wait around.
Marnie kicked Fran out of the house for female reasons, so, um, can you take care of him?
- Yeah, sure. Have a seat.
- (Fran) Awesome.
Yeah, settle in, son, and just let the nightmare wash over you.
- Yeah.
- It's nice in here. It's very, like,
Skull and Bones, secret gentlemen's society.
- Hi.
- Hi, hi. Oh, hello.
Suit looks great. Very... (clicks tongue) ...serious.
- I have to, um...
- Thank you. ...get back to the house or everyone's boobs are going to explode.
Okay.

Wow, I feel good, man. I feel incredible.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Yeah, I thought meditation was just naps, but it's like a whole thing.
(Man) Well, you know, it is.
It's like naps where you wake up.
And I'm so happy to be able to share that with both of you.
And you, you, oh!

I'm happy that you're here.
Thank you for being here.
Thanks.

- Fran.
- Hey, man.
- I'm Hannah's boyfriend.
- We met at Marnie's birthday.
- No, I know.
We went on a bike ride together, just you and me.
- You don't...
- Yeah, Fran.
- I love that name.
- (Fran) Yeah.
I love you, Fran.
I love you, too, man.
(Desi) This is among one of the greatest days of my life, you guys.
I'm getting married today.
- (Wolfie claps) Yes.
- (Elijah) Yep.
(Fran) Does anybody want a beer?
I have got this really good brew
- that you can only get upstate.
- No, thank you, Fran.
Yeah, I'm gonna take MDMA just
before the vows, so I shouldn't mix.
- Well, Fran, I'd fucking love one.
- Comin' in hot.
So, I've been living in Japan for, like, seven months now, and it has seeped into my soul.
Like, I swear, influenced me professionally, spiritually, the way I bathe, my choice of pens, everything.
(Woman) But how do you understand, like, what the fuck they're saying? I don't get it.
Oh, no, they speak better English than, like, any of us.
- Do they, really? No kidding.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, Bay-Bay...
- Yeah? No, Bebe, thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry, Bebe.
I'm so happy you're here.
Thank you for joining us.
Aw, thanks.
I'm happy to be here.
- This is really fun.
- Oh, good, good, good.
I saw on your website you did Sophia Bush's makeup for her sister's wedding.
I sure did.
You know what?
That was such a treat.
She is like a little angel.
She let me bring my 30-year-old daughter along and we had a ball.
I gotta tell you what, those Bushes know how to party.
You have a 30-year-old daughter?
- When did you have her?
- Oh, God, I don't know.
Okay, well, let's just talk about the aesthetic of the wedding.
- Okay.
- We're thinking Laurel Canyon classic.
So, does that mean anything to you?
Like, a Selena Gomez kind of thing?
Nope, let me try that one more time. Ah...
Let's do like a Ralph Lauren and Joni Mitchell.
Ah, artistic, but also with a nod to my cultural heritage, which is white Christian woman.
My fiancé and I, both musicians.
Okay, so Jesus. Selena Gomez meets Jesus. I can do it.
Yeah, so, right now, ah, Shosh's hair feels a little bit Japanese-y to me.
Just getting started. Don't worry, honey, it's gonna be great.
- Okay, great.
- Just go have yourself a glass of wine.
- Do whatever you wanna do.
- Relax.
- I'm totally easy, easygoing girl.
- Okay.
- You know me, right? And, um...
- Okay.
Just make sure you run everything by me before it's final.
I just wanna make sure I sign off on it before it's set in its spray, okay?
Thank you so much for being here, good-bye!
Oh, my God, it is so much fun.
(gasps)
- (laughing)
- Oh, fuck you.
It's horrendous.
(laughing) It's nice.
I think when it comes down, I'm gonna...
- Oh, oh, oh, it's not done?
- ...brush it.
(both laugh)
You look good.
Thank you. I found this.
Thanks, oh.
Honestly, I feel really bad for Marnie.
- Why?
- Her mother's a fucking lunatic.
Hannah is just being Hannah.
Shoshanna, since she got back from Japan is somehow even more like a cartoon.
(laughs)
I'm just trying to be a source of support.
- Thanks.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
- That's good, be of service.
Mm-hmm. And how is it over there?
You guys just, like, doing circle jerks and pounding beers?
